receiver-port: 33333 # The port is exposed to client/proxy and is used to receive client/proxy requests. When receiver-shards>1, the corresponding ports are receiver-ports + shard-index
index-sync-port: 35333 # The port is used for replicas to communicate index synchronization messages. Typicall, the leader sends index sync msgs and the followers receive them
index-sync-period-us: 50 # For every period, the leader replica will send a index sync message to followers, serves for slow path and heartbeat
request-ask-port: 36333 # When one follower is missing requests, they ask from the leader or other followers. The leader/followers send the missed requests to this port of this follower
index-ask-port: 37333 # When one follower is missing some index sync msgs, it asks the leader (or other followers) for the missing ones, and the leader (or other followers) send to the index-sync-port of the problematic follower

Similary, for unsynced log entries, if (1) they have been kept for more than reclaim-timeout-ms (2) they are not used by the worker threads; then they will be reclaimed
